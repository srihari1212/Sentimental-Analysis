                   The real time data been collected from the students through google sheets. The students were asked to give feedbacks on faculties of the current semester. The feedback was given in the form of sentences. "Stop words " package is used to ignore the stop words. Using the sentiment analysis tools named "TextBlob" is a Python (2 and 3) library for processing textual data. It provides a simple API for diving into common natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as part-of-speech tagging, noun phrase extraction, sentiment analysis, classification, translation, and more , which include finding the polarity and subjectivity  of the words used. The positive and negative words were segregated and the corresponding weightage was given. Using the analysis, each faculty was given ratings among them and these ratings were represented in a statistical plot. A control chart was plotted. Using these results, further actions can be taken as a prior measure to improve student’s understanding and recognise which faculty’s teaching was most preferred.
